Here you can find a simple "ToDo list" app(built with functional components), which was developed using React during my learning process.
Also SCSS is used for styles.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory(in a terminal):

npm install
npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

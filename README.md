Here you can find a simple "ToDo list" app(built with functional components), which was developed using React during my learning process.
Also SCSS is used for styles.

You can test it via GitHub Pages using this link: https://achegevara.github.io/todo-list-react/

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
